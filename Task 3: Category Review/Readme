üéÑ Seasonal Trends
There is a significant surge in chip transactions during the weeks leading up to Christmas. Sales see a "dramatic and notable increase" in November and December, which corresponds with the holiday season and more social gatherings.


üìà Trial Store Analysis
To measure the impact of a new store layout, a rigorous trial was conducted in stores 77, 86, and 88.


Methodology: For each trial store, a control store was selected based on similar pre-trial sales and customer numbers to isolate the new layout's impact.


Key Findings:

Trial stores 77 and 86 consistently outperformed their control stores in total sales and customer numbers.

The growth was statistically significant, often exceeding the 95th percentile confidence interval of the control stores.

The sales increase was driven by higher purchase volume, not price inflation, as the average price per unit remained stable.

Target Key Demographics: Focus marketing on Mainstream Young Singles/Couples, leveraging their preference for Tyrells and 175g Twisties.

Rollout Successful Layouts: Implement a phased rollout of the proven trial store layout to a wider set of stores, prioritizing those with similar demographic profiles.
